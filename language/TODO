have headCall and tailCall operate on NockCall objects
  built from a NockFunction and an Object (subject)

Eval gets one more wrapper that packages up its subject expression and function
lookup into a NockCall

ObjectLookup -> PullLookup
  does lookup the object, but also grabs an arm and builds a NockCall,
  so we don't have to cache in more than one place 
  (since the object lookup per site always also has an arm index to lookup)

NockFunctionDispatchNode -> NockCallDispatchNode

Move NockFunction to data
Move Axis to data
Exceptions
  NockException -- thrown only from truffle nodes
  Exit          -- checked, nock crash (like java Exception)
  Fail          -- unchecked, representational exceptions 
                              (Errors like out of memory, stack overflow)
