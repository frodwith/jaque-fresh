kind of map that is one-thing-then-a-hashmap, for use in Registration

REFLECTION
  We can't load user-supplied classes from the generated native images.
  Jet configuration can be un-static, for sure, but it has to select from
  pre-existing implementation node classes. IE, AddNode has to baked into the
  native image, but someone can tell that image "this is how you match an add,
  use your baked in AddNode."

Jet hot Dashboard
  on boot, need to iterate through whole dashboard and discover from hot
    i don't think this is actually the case? it's fine to use the hot dashboard
    simply as a source of discovery for unspotted cores. we don't need to respot
    everything every time we get new hot info.

put transferToInterpreters in the various places where RegistrationNodes replace();

put NockFunctions in a cache instead of a map, don't depend on value equality
  maybe.

Fast
  test by jetting dec/add and running large mul

Test CellMeta caching (w/edit)

Memo
  with One Big Guava Cache
  and tests
Slog
  tests can capture logs right?
Stack Hints

Step through some nock in a debugger

Command line nock interpreter (with native-image)

Boot a ride pill
  mostly this is a lot of jetting
