Test all the new Slog stuff
  List tests (unit-test each libary function, examples should be fine)
  Tank tests (wash at least one example of each kind, some should line break)
  Slog hint test with mock logger

Stack Hints
  Create a new local variable, tax.
  to process a stack hint,
    1) compute the clue
    2) set tax accordingly
    3) TruffleRuntime.createVirtualFrame(...)
    4) execute tail-formula in fresh frame
    5) unset tax

  Catchers of NockException can call TruffleStackTraceElement.getStackTrace(e),
  get the frames, and collect tax. Without a kernel the command line
  interpreters will print the java stack trace and die. With a kernel, they
  collect and pass the tax to +mook, getting a toon, and log the resulting (list
  tank). And then maybe die, depending on what mode they're in. Look ma, no
  Context!
