Invalid formulas --
  [6 [1 0] [1 %perfectly-cromulent] %definitely-a-crash] ... this could be a
  valid formula (fsvo valid). it should crash not when we try to compile it, but
  the definitely a crash branch should be compiled as a bail. when you try to
  run it, you should just get "%perfectly-cromulent", since the false-branch will
  never occur.

Potentially, we could have an edit message.
