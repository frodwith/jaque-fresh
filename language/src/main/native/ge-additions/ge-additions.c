// Group Element Additions
//
// Urbit uses the ge.h code from the ed25519 library, which was ported from the
// ref10 SUPERCOP public domain implementation. That implementation doesn't
// contain several functions needed for ring signatures.
//
// This file does. The providence of this code starts with Adam Langley taking
// the SUPERCOP C implementation and producing an ed25519 implementation for it
// in golang (https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/crypto/ed25519). (If you look at
// the go code, you'll see the comments are the same as the comments in the C
// implementation.)
//
// From there, the DEDIS group from ETH Zurich took that implementation and
// added the additional methods to make a generalized ECC point library. While
// their project as a whole is MPL, they deliberately left their ed25519
// implementation under the Go BSD-3 license:
// (https://github.com/dedis/kyber/blob/master/group/edwards25519/LICENSE)
//
// This file is a fairly straight translation from Go to C of DEDIS' additions,
// so this falls under the same license.
